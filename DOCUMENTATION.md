## API Structure and Design Decisions

### Architecture Overview

The Recruitment Platform is built using a modern full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, React Router, and TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### API Structure

The API follows a RESTful design pattern with clear resource-based endpoints:

```
/api/auth - Authentication endpoints
/api/users - User profile management
```

#### Authentication Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Access |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | Register a new user | Public |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Login a user | Public |
| `/api/auth/me` | GET | Get current user profile | Private |

#### User Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Access |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/users/profile` | GET | Get user profile | Private |
| `/api/users/profile` | PUT | Update user profile | Private |

### Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Controllers handle request/response logic
   - Models define database schemas and business logic
   - Routes define API endpoints
   - Middleware handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication

2. **TypeScript Integration**:
   - Strong typing for better developer experience
   - Interface definitions for data models
   - Type safety across the application

3. **Context API for State Management**:
   - React Context API for global state management
   - Custom hooks for accessing authentication state
   - Reducer pattern for predictable state updates

4. **Responsive UI with TailwindCSS**:
   - Utility-first CSS framework
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Consistent styling across components

## Authentication Flow and Security

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration Process**:
   - User submits registration form with name, email, and password
   - Backend validates input data
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt
   - User record is created in the database
   - JWT token is generated and returned to the client
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage
   - User is redirected to their profile page

2. **Login Process**:
   - User submits login form with email and password
   - Backend validates credentials
   - Password is verified against the hashed version
   - JWT token is generated and returned to the client
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage
   - User is redirected to their profile page

3. **Authentication Verification**:
   - Protected routes check for token presence
   - Token is verified on the backend
   - User information is attached to the request
   - If token is invalid or expired, user is redirected to login

### Security Measures

1. **Password Security**:
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
   - Original passwords are never stored in the database
   - Password complexity requirements enforced on frontend

2. **JWT Implementation**:
   - Tokens include user ID and expiration time
   - Tokens are signed with a secure secret key
   - Token expiration is set to 30 days (configurable)
   - Authorization header used for token transmission

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Authentication middleware for protected endpoints
   - React router protection for frontend routes
   - Automatic redirection for unauthenticated users

4. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Configured to allow only specific origins
   - Prevents cross-site request forgery

5. **Input Validation**:
   - Server-side validation using express-validator
   - Client-side validation for immediate feedback
   - Sanitization of inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Error Management and Input Validation

### Error Handling Approach

1. **Consistent Error Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Descriptive error message"
   }
   ```

2. **HTTP Status Codes**:
   - 200: Successful operation
   - 201: Resource created
   - 400: Bad request (validation errors)
   - 401: Unauthorized (authentication required)
   - 404: Resource not found
   - 500: Server error

3. **Error Types**:
   - Validation errors (form inputs)
   - Authentication errors (invalid credentials)
   - Authorization errors (insufficient permissions)
   - Resource errors (not found, already exists)
   - Server errors (unexpected issues)

4. **Frontend Error Handling**:
   - Global error state in Context API
   - Form-specific error states
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Loading states to indicate processing

### Input Validation

1. **Backend Validation**:
   - express-validator for request validation
   - Schema validation with Mongoose
   - Custom validation middleware

2. **Frontend Validation**:
   - Form validation before submission
   - Real-time feedback on input errors
   - Disabled submission for invalid forms

3. **Validation Rules**:
   - Email format validation
   - Password minimum length and complexity
   - Required fields checking
   - Type checking for numeric fields

## Scaling and Improvement Suggestions

### Backend Scaling

1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Implement database indexing for frequently queried fields
   - Consider sharding for horizontal scaling
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add caching layer with Redis for frequently accessed data

2. **API Performance**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Consider GraphQL for more efficient data fetching
   - Implement query optimization

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Deploy using containerization (Docker)
   - Implement load balancing for horizontal scaling
   - Set up auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
   - Use a CDN for static assets

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Add error tracking and alerting
   - Implement health checks

### Frontend Improvements

## Database Schema

### User Schema

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  role: String (enum: ['user', 'recruiter', 'admin']),
  skills: [String],
  experience: Number,
  education: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Indexes

- `email`: Unique index for fast lookups and to ensure uniqueness

### Relationships (for future expansion)

- User to Job Applications: One-to-Many
- User to Job Postings (for recruiters): One-to-Many
